Teaser:

This project will describe how to use Raspberry Pi B+, A+, 2 or Odroid-W and Arduino Pro Mini to realize a RC link to a vehicle over WLAN.

It's mainly for FPV usage in combination with a HD video stream.

At the ground side it takes the PPM signal of a standard RC transmitter with up to 12 channel.

At the air side it gives up to 8 PWM and a PPM with up to 12 channel simultaniously with a resolution of one micro second using the Arduino Pro Mini IO.

It also realizes a fully configurable two stage failsafe feature in case of link loss.

Usage of up to 6 ADC, 2 PWM in and a serial port for telemetry data like GPS is also possible.

Dedicated telemetry data via speech output.
